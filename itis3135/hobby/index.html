                Hello! My name is Ethan Arguello and I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
                I have always enjoyed reading books of all kinds since I was a child.
                Reading has always been a way for me to escape reality and enter new worlds full of adventure, mystery, and excitement.
                In my free time, I enjoy sitting in my reading nook with a good book and a cup of hot coco.

            <p>
                I enjoy reading both fiction, non-fiction books, graphic novels, and manga.
                one of my favorite authors is J.K. Rowling, who wrote the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> series. 
                I used to read diary of a wimpy kid and the magic tree house series when I was younger.

                Any time is a good time to read!
                However, I find that reading after doing my homework and before bed is the most relaxing and enjoyable time.
                It helps me unwind and clear my mind before going to sleep.
                Sometimes I can find some time while waiting for doctors appointments or other errands to read a few pages.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My favorite seasonal time to read is during the fall and winter months. 
                The cooler weather and shorter days make it the perfect time to curl up with a good book and a warm blanket.
                Drinking a warm beverage like hot cocoa with marshmellows while reading really makes the experience way better!
                It melts all my worries away

        <!-- Where section -->

            <p>
                Almost anywhere can be a good place to read however the more I read the more I find certain places to be better than others.
                Some people choose local book cafes or coffee shops to read in.
                I prefer the quiet and ease of access to books of a public library. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                One of these days when I have the time I really want to craft a reading nook.
                Some choices for inspiration for me are to get a soft sinking sofa chair, beanbag, or small bed. 
                probably going to pair it with a comfy pillow, warm and soft blanket and a stockpile some high quality hot chocolate and maybe make homemade marshmellows instead of the storebought ones.
                I currently don't really have the space or the money for a decent reading nook but I might try to make a small ceiling corner with a comfy bed and good air conditioning.
                I would even have a nice sturdy ladder to climb up to it!

        <!-- How section -->

            <p>
                It all started really when I was a kid and my mom used to read me bedtime stories.
                I really loved those picturebooks of the classic fairy tales like <cite>The 500 Hats Of Bartholomew Cubbins</cite> and the <cite>Cars</cite> picture books.
                As I got older I started reading chapter books like <cite>Magic Tree House</cite> and <cite>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</cite>.
                Then of course I got into the <cite>Harry Potter</cite> series and that really sparked my love for reading.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But reading for school was always a chore for me.
                I kinda lost my will to read for a while in middle school and high school due to all the required reading lists, tests, quizzes, and essays.
                I did very much enjoy reading shakespeare and <cite>The Outsiders</cite> in school but other than that I really stopped enjoying reading much if any other books. 
                And it wasn't until I found manga and graphic novels that I really started to enjoy reading again albeit with more pictures funnily enough

            <p>
                To start the reasons of why I still read I though to include this quote by Mark Twain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>"The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read". </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Reading is a fun way to pass the time, however it is also a great way to learn new things, expand my vocabulary, and improve my focus and concentration.
                Reading can also help reduce stress, improve your memory, and enhance your creativity.
                Many Studies have shown that reading can also improve your mental health, increase cognitive function, and improve sleep quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from all the health benefits it is also a great way to pass the time, connect with fellow reader and friends, and enhance your grasp on the world as we know it
                And you can never run out of books to read! There is always something new and exciting to discover within the pages of a book.
